Certainly! Here is an expanded and highly detailed Confluence page for your log archiving and backup solution using Cloud Logging → Log Sink → Cloud Storage (Archive class) for a 2-year retention strategy. This version includes clear context, technical explanation, architectural flow, and operational considerations.

📄 Log Archiving and Backup Strategy – GCP (2-Year Retention)
🔍 Executive Summary
To meet internal audit, compliance, and forensic investigation requirements, our team needs to retain Google Cloud Platform (GCP) logs for at least 2 years. After evaluating the log generation rate, cost models, and platform capabilities, we propose a scalable and cost-efficient solution leveraging:

Cloud Logging for capturing logs

Log Sinks for exporting logs

Cloud Storage (Archive Class) for long-term archiving

This strategy ensures that logs are securely retained for 2 years, are tamper-proof, and can be restored or queried if needed, while minimizing storage costs.

📊 Log Volume Summary
Metric	Value
Average Monthly Volume	1.62 TB
12-Month Volume	~19.44 TB
24-Month Volume (2 years)	~38.88 TB

📌 Requirements
Retain all logs (including GCE, GKE, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, and custom application logs) for 2 years

Ensure data integrity and security

Provide mechanism for future audit access

Optimize for low cost due to high log volume

🛠️ Proposed Architecture Overview
🔄 Flow
Logs are generated by services and workloads (e.g., Compute Engine, Kubernetes, Cloud Run).

Logs are automatically ingested into Cloud Logging.

A Log Sink is configured to export logs in near real-time to a Cloud Storage bucket.

The bucket is configured with Archive storage class, optimized for long-term retention.

Lifecycle rules ensure automatic deletion of logs after 2 years.

🖼️ Architecture Diagram
🧱 Component Breakdown
1. 🔹 Cloud Logging
Captures logs from all GCP services and custom applications.

Supports structured logging and filters.

Retention:

Default: 30 days

Extended: up to 10 years with custom Log Buckets (expensive)

2. 🔶 Log Sink
A log router that exports logs to external storage systems.

Sink types: Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, BigQuery

Export Format: JSONL (default for GCS)

Can apply filters (e.g., severity, log type, resource type)

IAM writer identity needs permissions on the destination

3. 🟡 Cloud Storage – Archive Class
Purpose-built for infrequently accessed data

Cheapest class: $0.0012/GB/month

Access latency: ~15ms per file

Designed for compliance and archival data

Integrated with CMEK, IAM, and audit logging

4. 🔐 Bucket Lifecycle Management
Rule: Delete objects after 730 days (2 years)

Prevents accumulation and manages storage automatically

💰 Cost Analysis
Storage Option	Cost/GB/month	2-Year Total Cost (38.88 TB)
Cloud Logging (Log Bucket)	$0.50	~$466,560
Cloud Storage (Archive)	$0.0012	~$1,120

➡️ >99% cost savings using Cloud Storage Archive class over Cloud Logging long-term retention.

📌 Pros and Cons
✅ Benefits of Cloud Storage Archiving
💰 Extremely low cost

🛡️ Durable and secure (11 9s durability)

🗂️ Custom lifecycle and encryption policies

📈 Scales with project growth

🔒 Ideal for compliance, audit trails, and backup

⚠️ Considerations
🔍 Logs are not searchable in Logs Explorer

🧪 Rehydration requires loading data into BigQuery/Dataflow

📦 Large files or heavily nested logs may require pre-processing

🚀 Implementation Guide
Step 1: Create GCS Bucket
Name: gcp-log-archive-<env/project>

Class: Archive

Access: Uniform bucket-level

Region: Prefer regional close to primary workloads

Enable Object Versioning: optional

Encryption: Use CMEK or Google-managed key

Step 2: Configure Log Sink
Go to Logging > Logs Router

Create a new Sink:

Name: archive-sink

Destination: storage.googleapis.com/<bucket-name>

Logs to include: All logs or use filter

Writer Identity: Grant access to bucket

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud logging sinks create archive-sink \
  storage.googleapis.com/gcp-log-archive \
  --log-filter="severity>=DEFAULT" \
  --project=<your-project-id>
Step 3: Set Bucket Lifecycle Policy
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "rule": [
    {
      "action": { "type": "Delete" },
      "condition": { "age": 730 }
    }
  ]
}
Apply via:

bash
Copy
Edit
gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://gcp-log-archive
🔁 Optional: Rehydrating Logs for Analysis
If logs need to be queried or analyzed:

Load JSONL files from GCS into BigQuery (via Dataflow, Cloud Functions)

Define schema based on exported fields

Create views/dashboards in Looker Studio or Grafana

🔐 Security Best Practices
Assign only required IAM roles (Storage Object Viewer, Storage Admin)

Enable Bucket Logging and Access Transparency

Use CMEK encryption for sensitive logs

Apply VPC Service Controls (if required)
